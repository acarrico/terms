terms, by Anthony Carrico <acarrico@memebeam.org>

This work is in the public domain.

Work with fully expanded program terms in Racket.

TEST:

In the terms directory, try
  raco test main.rkt
to run the rackunit tests. Look at the tests for examples.

USE:

From the parent of the terms directory, link the collection with
  raco link terms
and then use terms as a module. For example:

  #lang racket
  (require terms)
  (term=? #'(#%plain-lambda (x) x) #'(#%plain-lambda (y) y))

READ:

The source code is outlined with allout mode in emacs. It is most
convenient. When you see a line starting with ";;;_*", put the cursor
on the bullet and use the h and s keys to hide and show the content.
